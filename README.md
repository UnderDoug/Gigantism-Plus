# Gigantism Plus

This mod enhances and enables for character creation, the physical defect Gigantism, retaining its base game functionality while introducing new mechanics. With this mod, Gigantism can be improved with mutation points as you level up, making it a unique defect that can be ranked up to offset its drawbacks and become useful.

## Features

- **Gigantic Fists:** A scaling natural weapon considered a cudgel and fully compatible with the cudgel skill line. These fists spawn on all your arms as hands, regardless of their number from mutations and chimeric arms. They act like standard fists but are gigantic weapons, providing an automatic +3 to damage from the start. They scale with the Gigantism defect, increasing from 1d3 damage by d1 every 3 ranks and 1d every 5 ranks. At rank 10, they deal 3d6 damage with no maximum penetration cap, allowing unlimited utilization of your strength. While powerful, they are still outclassed by gigantic-sized melee weapons, which you can now wield as if they were standard weapons. They also start at a -3 to hit, which raises by 1 every 2 ranks.

- **Gigantic Gear Only:** As per the standard game rules, you cannot wear or wield anything that lacks the gigantic mod, making gear hunting a challenge. To balance this, I've enabled the tinkering mod for gigantic, allowing you to add it to your own items, and decreased its rarity slightly. You can find data disks for the modification and learn it through tinkering skills and disassembly. Keep in mind, Gigantism is a Physical Defect, not a standard mutation, and it's not meant to make the game easier.

- **Weight and Furniture Interaction:** With Gigantism, you weigh more and can break non-gigantic chairs, beds, and other furniture. Be mindful where you park your gigantic butt! You can also carry much more weight by default in the base game, which will be great for carrying around all your newly tinkered gigantic items.

- **Potential Enemy Enhancements:** Some enemies might be slightly more dangerous now that they have natural weapons due to the edited base game logic of Gigantism, although gigantic enemies are pretty rare in my testing, and I'm unsure if they have the ability to possess levels in it.

## Contributing

If you want to [contribute](https://github.com/hyd-n-plyn-syt/Gigantism-Plus), feel free to let me know or make a request! This mod has primarily been tested by me, so please report any issues, and we'll work to resolve them!

**Things to work out or implement**:
- Better process for adjusting the tinkerable modifiers list post Blueprint Preload. Currently using "ductape" to achieve this and something more likely to be compatible with other mods is preferable.
- Process to overcome late-game softlock based on gigantic creatures and their inability to fit into certain interior spaces.

**Enjoy your adventure with your gigantic mutants, and have fun!**
