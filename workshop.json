  "Title": "Gigantism Plus",
  "Description": "This mod enhances greatly and enables for character creation, the physical defect Gigantism, retaining its base game functionality while introducing new mechanics. With this mod, Gigantism can be improved with mutation points as you level up, making it a unique defect that can be ranked up to offset its drawbacks and become useful.\r\n\r\n[h2]Updates[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b] New Cybernetic for True Kin: Exoframes![/b]\r\n[*][b] Compatibility with Agolgot Chord, Helping Hands, and all versions of cybernetic hand bones(even modded).\r\n[*][b] Gigantic creatures receive a 1 tile bonus to jump, and cause Stunning Force splash damage when leaping 3 or more tiles, further enhanced by some Exoframe models.[/b]\r\n[*][b]And tons of other bug-fixes and adjustments! You can always see more details in the [url=https://https://github.com/hyd-n-plyn-syt/Gigantism-Plus/activity]Github Change Log[/url], including upcoming changes from the experimental and other branches.[/b][/list]\r\n[h1]Features[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]Gigantism:[/b] All of it's base features, plus a [b]gigantic[/b] amount of new ones!\r\n\r\nA scaling natural weapon fully compatible with the cudgel skills. These fists apply to all your arms regardless of their number from mutations and chimerism. They are double dice fists and gigantic weapons, providing an automatic +3 to damage from the start. They scale with the Gigantism defect, increasing every 2 ranks. They have no maximum penetration cap, allowing unlimited utilization of your strength. While powerful, they are still outclassed by some gigantic-sized melee weapons, which you can now wield as if they were standard weapons. The fists and their variants start at a -3 to hit, which raises by 1 every 2 ranks.\r\n\r\nAs per the standard game rules, you cannot wear or wield anything that lacks the gigantic mod, making gear hunting a challenge. You will now spawn with gigantic gear, despite your calling, if you choose gigantic or it's cybernetic equivalent.\r\n\r\nYou can toggle the ability to tinker gigantic onto items that will accept it, and the rarity of gigantic items spawning in the world in the options menu. All changes to the options require a new character, and reload of game. All natural weapons will also turn into gigantic weapons, gaining +3 damage.\r\n\r\nYou weigh more and can break non-gigantic chairs, beds, and other furniture. Be mindful where you park your gigantic butt! You can also carry much more weight by default in the base game, which will be great for carrying around all your newly tinkered gigantic items. We've added in new interactions with Gigantism as well. So far, gigantic torches have twice the range.\r\n\r\n[*][b]Endgame Softlock Fixed:[/b] In the base game, you are not allowed to enter small spaces as a gigantic creature, which essentially breaks an important endgame quest line. We've added in [b]Hunch[/b] and [b]Straighten Up[/b], two new active abilities that toggle being hunched over, allowing you to squeeze into small spaces. Added compatibility with mods that add small spaces, like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1683847053]Hearthpyre[/url](unaware of any others at the time, but should work great if they add them as interiors!).\r\n\r\n[*][b]Elongated Paws:[/b] New mutation in the style of the Urshiib! These are an adaptation of the Giant Hands cybernetic found within the base game, and allow you to use gigantic equipment worn on hands and wielded, including missile slots. Plus your quill bear friends will like you a little more since they now have them in order to compliment their triple-jointedness. In combination with Gigantism, this mutation will even allow you to wield gigantic two-handed equipment, single-handed.\r\n\r\n[*][b]Cybernetics:[/b] We've added in the ability to gain Gigantism temporarily through the use of a new line of cybernetics called Exoframes. There are multiple models that grant you varying ranks of Gigantism depending upon their Tier, and if you already have Gigantism, they give you more ranks in it like Rapid Advancement would, augmenting the abilities of your Gigantic stature. Cybernetic hand bone replacements will also now synergize correctly with all hand mutations.\r\n\r\n[*][b]Gigantic Creatures:[/b] In the base game creatures were tagged as gigantic, but there was no real indication of their size beyond the description, and they didn't appear to actually have the defect applied to them. Gigantism has been added back to these creatures, given a physical feature so that it shows upon looking at them, and applies to them in every way it would yourself. That includes Templar Mechs and Golems! We've added a couple more to the list that felt appropriate, but feel free to let us know if you find more! Gigantic creatures will also now spawn with gigantic gear if you toggle the options. Watch out!\r\n\r\n[*][b]Mutation Synergies:[/b] Natural weapons from mutations don't usually play well together, so we're making an effort to find all related and relevant mutations and adding in compatibility with Gigantism and related mutations, including adding in new natural weapon states for combined mutations. This currently includes Gigantic Fists, Elongated Paws, Burrowing Claws, and Crystallinity. Flaming/Freezing Ray will also add to the massive name, granting their temperature changes on hit. It also includes all of their combinations for now, so look forward to wielding Freezing gigantic elongated burrowing crystalline points!\r\n\r\n[*][b]Modular:[/b] In the options menu, you can toggle several features of the mod. Tinkering the gigantic mod on to items, for yourself and for NPCs. The rarity of the gigantic mod on objects in the world. Allowing Rapid Advancement of the mutation as you would any other mutation. Toggling starting with gigantic gear if you're a gigantic character, and toggling on and off whether grenades are effected by this. Most of the options now take effect after a reload of a save, unless otherwise marked.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Contributing[/h1]\r\n\r\nIf you have any [url=https://github.com/hyd-n-plyn-syt/Gigantism-Plus/issues]ideas or bug reports[/url], or want to contribute to the [url=https://github.com/hyd-n-plyn-syt/Gigantism-Plus/tree/experimental]Experimental Branch[/url], feel free to let me know or make a request!
