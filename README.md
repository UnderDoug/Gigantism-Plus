# Gigantism Plus
This collaborative modification for _**[Caves of Qud](https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/)**_ enhances greatly and enables for character creation, the physical defect Gigantism. It retains all of it's base game functionality while introducing _**MANY**_ new mechanics. With this mod, Gigantism can be improved with mutation points, is subject to rapid advancement like standard mutations, and interacts with base game mutations and everything added by this mod in various ways. Gigantism Plus adds in:
* New natural weapons and interactions with the vanilla ones in various new ways.
* A new mutation called Elongated Paws in the style of the Urshiib that will allow non-Gigantism characters to wield gigantic weapons.
* Cybernetics to keep the True Kin on an even playing field, and interactions with old cybernetics when used alongside Gigantism.
* A new factions of giants, and their new enemies!
* New locations and Giant-Only interactions!

## Updates
**Total refactoring of the entire mod from bottom to top, since top to bottom never makes sense. Damage scaling, class names, and almost every feature of this mod has been redone with sanity and ease of integration in mind, with a massive list of new additions and outright changes that include Gigantism related Factions and Cybernetics. Read below on the new wiki based on Github for further details!**
